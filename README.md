# NextJS Project Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction ðŸ¥‚

This boilerplate is based in the following technologies:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- [Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

## Getting Started ðŸŽ¬

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, check if the project needs any environment variable. If the project has in the root a `.env.example` file, you will need to set the environment variables listed in the file in a .env.local file.

For more information about environment variables in Next.js Apps [learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) in this resource.

Finnaly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
